# Dev Journey Static Website

This project is part of my Dev Journey, a structured, project-based exploration of software development concepts through hands-on projects.

This project focuses on web fundamentals, responsive design, and client-side interactivity, providing a first real-world experience with a static website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.

---

## Project goals

* Explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals in a practical project
* Build a responsive and accessible website layout
* Implement interactive UI features such as:
  * Accordion-style project sections
  * Smooth scroll navigation
  * Responsive burger menu for mobile
* Practice clean, maintainable front-end code organization
* Learn to combine structure, style, and behavior in a single web project

---

## Features

* Responsive layout with CSS Flexbox and media queries
* Sticky navigation bar with smooth scrolling
* Mobile-first burger menu toggle
* Project sections with expandable details (accordion)
* Interactive contact form with client-side validation and success message
* Clean, semantic HTML structure
* Modern CSS design with custom variables for colors and spacing
* Minimal JavaScript for UI behavior (no frameworks required)

---

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser:

```bash
# Open in default browser (example on Mac)
open index.html

# Or open locally in Chrome/Firefox/Edge
```
No server or build process is required — this is a fully static website.

---

## How it works

- HTML provides semantic structure and content
- CSS handles layout, responsive design, and visual styling
- JavaScript adds interactivity:
  * Accordion toggle for projects
  * Smooth scroll navigation
  * Burger menu toggle on mobile
  * Contact form feedback without page reload
- All assets are local; no external dependencies are required

This ensures the website is lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain.

## Project structure

```bash
.
├── index.html           # Main HTML page
├── style.css            # Styling for layout, typography, and components
├── script.js            # JavaScript for interactivity
└── README.md
```

## Technologies used

- HTML 5
- CSS 3 (Flexbox, Grid, variables, media queries)
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS, DOM manipulation, event listeners)
- No frameworks, no libraries — pure web basics

---

## Key concepts practiced

- Semantic HTML and accessibility
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- CSS variables, shadows, and transitions
- JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling
- UI/UX patterns: accordion, sticky nav, smooth scroll
- Form handling and user feedback
- Clean separation of structure, style, and behavior

---

## Scope & limitations

- Fully static: no backend, no database
- Contact form feedback is client-side only (no emails are sent)
- Designed for educational purposes and learning web fundamentals
- Minimal dependencies and no build tools

---

## How this fits into my dev journey

This project represents a milestone in learning **front-end web development**:

- Transition from CLI-based applications to browser-based interfaces
- Understanding the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Implementing responsive and interactive UI components
- Preparing for more advanced web development projects with frameworks or back-end integration
